I'm a machine learning engineer in the bay area. I've been lucky enough to work at and with some great research institutions, startups, and companies at the intersection of machine learning and data quality. I started my career as part of the academic research staff at the University of Wisconsin, doing research with [Theodoros Rekatsinas](thodrek.github.io). Afterwards, I became a graduate student at the University of Waterloo, and a founding engineer at Inductiv, which was [acquired by Apple](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/27/apple-buys-machine-learning-specialist-inductiv-to-bolster-siri-ai-projects). After a few years at Apple working on knowledge graph construction, I moved to [Snorkel](https://snorkel.ai/).

I'm figuring out what my next project will be. Reach out if you're interested in working together!
